# Introduction

## About this Workshop
This workshop is a hands-on lab dedicated to the features and functionality of Oracle Database security to prevent, detect and mitigate the most common cyberattacks performed on Oracle Databases - for more details on each of the featured products, please refer to the following workshops:
- [DB Security Basics](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=698)
- [DB Security Advanced](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=726) labs.

Cybercriminals are becoming more and more equipped and better prepared. They now have a substantial technological arsenal that allows them to launch attacks against you from almost everywhere if you are not prepared to deal with them.

During this workshop, you will perform different scenarios:
- **as an attacker** - your main objective will be to exfiltrate sensitive data from the target database before encrypting the database as part of a ransomware attack
- **as a defender** - your main objective will be to prevent, detect and mitigate these attacks

In order to make this possible, we provide you with the necessary infrastructure components based on an OCI architecture, deployed in a few minutes, so that you can test the most common attacks exploited on a database by hackers with a simple internet connection.

As all these components are stored in the workshop's DBSec-Lab VM, you can conduct your attack without any risk and without fear of breaking anything to test database security use cases in an environment pre-configured by the Oracle Database Security Product Manager Team.

*Estimated Time*: 40 minutes

### Objectives
This lab helps you learn to use some of the most important security features of the Oracle Database.

You will learn how to:
- Prevent, detect and mitigate data exfiltration
- Prevent and detect privileges escalation and abuse
- Prevent and mitigate exploitation of vulnerabilities

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle Cloud Account - Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported

*Note: If you have a **Free Trial** account, when your Free Trial expires your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account. You will not be able to conduct Free Tier workshops unless the Always Free environment is available. **[Click here for the Free Tier FAQ page.](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/faq.html)***

So that your experience of this workshop is the best possible, DO NOT FORGET to perform "Lab: *Initialize Environment*" to be sure that all these resources are correctly set up!

The entire Database Security team wishes you an excellent workshop!

You may now proceed to the next lab.
